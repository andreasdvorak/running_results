Coding Style

We want your work to be readable by others; therefore, we encourage you to note the following:

Please write in Python 3.7+. For instance: print() is a function in Python 3 so print "Hello" will not work but print("Hello") will.

Please focus hard on naming of functions, classes, and variables. Help your reader by using descriptive names that can help you to remove redundant comments.
    
Expand acronyms because gcd() is hard to understand but greatest_common_divisor() is not.
    
Please follow the Python Naming Conventions so variable_names and function_names should be lower_case, CONSTANTS in UPPERCASE, ClassNames should be CamelCase, etc.
